# IndicTexts
Digitized version of old texts on scriptures and mythology of Hinduism

## Introduction
The richness of India's customs and traditions stems out of the immortal words of its ancient sages. Since the days of old, many literary works have been propapagated simply by listening to oral recitations. Although several texts do exist, there are volumes that have never been translated and so, unavailable in the public domain. Our objective in creating this repository is to make such texts readily available in a simple and readable format so that everyone can banefit from the wisdom contained in the following ancient compositions. 

In order to achieve this goal, old texts have been recovered through page scans and processed through [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) technology to extract textual content from these sources. The text thus extracted in the original script has then been processed through language services to translate it to English. Neither of these steps which are based on artificial intelligence is guaranteed to provide 100% correct results and therefore it is possible that readers may discover errors in the final translation. We do apologize for these inaccuracies in advance and make no claims whatsoever regarding the veracity and consistency of the text provided.

Having said that, we heartily welcome contributions from the wider community to correct the purport and meaning of these texts. Contributors may [create pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) so can easily review the changes and incorporate them into the main text. If this method of correct appears to be overly complicated, one may also create suggestions on the [Issues](https://github.com/DuttaSoumya/IndicTexts/issues) page citing the proper references, but we request readers to kindly be patient when awaiting a response to your queries.

We hereby wish you readers the very best in gathering the knowledge imparted by these texts and hope that you would find it to your benefit.
