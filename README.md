## Introduction
The richness of India's customs and traditions stems from the immortal words of its ancient sages. Since the days of old, many literary works have been propapagated simply by listening to oral recitations. Although several texts do exist, there are volumes that have never been translated and are therefore not available in the public domain. The objective of creating this repository is to make such texts readily available in a simple and readable format so that everyone can banefit from the wisdom contained in the following ancient compositions. 

### The initiative
In order to achieve this goal, old texts have been recovered through page scans and processed through [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) technology to extract textual content from these sources. The text thus extracted in the original script has then been processed through language services to translate it to English. Neither of these steps, which are based on [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), is guaranteed to provide 100% correct results and therefore it is possible that readers may discover errors in the final translation. **We do apologize for these inaccuracies in advance and make no claims whatsoever regarding the veracity and consistency of the text provided. We encourage readers to refer to the original text in such cases.** Moreover, because of lack of a full understanding of the context and the original language on our part, in cases when a meaningful translation was not possible, we have humbly placed a question mark (?) to indicate to the readers that a particular verse still awaits a proper translation.

### Contributions are welcome!
Having said that, contributions from the wider community to correct the purport and meaning of these texts are heartily welcomed. Contributors may [create pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) so the changes can be easily reviewed and incorporated into the main text. If this method of correction appears to be overly complicated, one may also create comments or suggestions on the [Issues](https://github.com/DuttaSoumya/IndicTexts/issues) page citing the proper references, but readers are kindly requested to be patient when awaiting a response to their queries. 

> Best efforts have been made to keep the literal translation of the text as close as possible to the original and not to over- interpret the texts so that the readers may derive their own conclusions from it. Of course, plenty of interpretations may be found elsewhere on the internet but we have consciously avoided doing so ourselves and would expect the same from the contributors as they provide their own translations.

### Thank you
We hereby wish our readers the very best in gathering the knowledge imparted by these texts and hope that they benefit from this endeavour!
